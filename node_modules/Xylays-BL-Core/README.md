- Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a **WebSocket**. 
- Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like **half a gig** of ram :/ 
- Baileys supports interacting with the multi-device & web versions of WhatsApp.
- Thank you to [@pokearaujo](https://github.com/pokearaujo/multidevice) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Multi-Device. Also, thank you to [@Sigalor](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to [@Rhymen](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/) for the __go__ implementation.
